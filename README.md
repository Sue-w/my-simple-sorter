HELLO!

This is a simple sorting app.
Initially created to test out deployments in an online Kubernetes Playground.

Hope it works.

UPDATE:

  * Deployment works.
  * However, since my Docker image is not shared on Docker Hub, online playgrounds and other machines cannot pull it as it is not in the publicly available on Docker Hub.
