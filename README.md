HELLO.

This is a simple sorting app.
Initially created to test out deployments in an online Kubernetes Playground.

Hope it works.

**UPDATE:**

  * Deployment works.
  * However, since my Docker image is not shared on Docker Hub, online playgrounds and other machines cannot pull it as it is not in the publicly available on Docker Hub. 

See [what I did to deploy a simple app in Kubernetes](https://github.com/Sue-w/my-simple-sorter/blob/master/Deploying-steps.md)
